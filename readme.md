## overview:

This is a rough proof of concept, using a html app to build retro JRPG battle scene, including a mobile-friendly interface, gesture control, state switch function, attack animations, dynamic background, BGM and sound.

You can rewrite script to replace different background and sprites. 

Respect knowledge copyright and enjoy.

## roadmap:

I have some crazy plan for features.

However, I'm not a good web programer, achieving them will take a lot of time and a lot of learning.
Very possible, I'll get frustrated in the middle and abandon this project. 
So please don't expect too much.
